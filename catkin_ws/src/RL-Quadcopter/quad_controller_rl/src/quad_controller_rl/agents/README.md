# DeepRL Agents

In this folder you find all steps I took to develop the actor-critic agents based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient method. 

For the Take-Off task the final version that worked well was the 'my_policy_num5.py'. 

If you want to try other agent or test your own, you need to change the '__init__.py' file.
